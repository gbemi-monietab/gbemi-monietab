### Hi there 👋

---
### 🔥 About me

---

🙋 I am Gbemisola Kotoye ✨, a **Software Developer** specializing in **Back End Development**.

👨🏽‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and I'm really enthusiatic about learning new technology. I specialize in **ReactJs**, **TypeScript/JavaScript** and **Nextjs**. Recently, I got started on **NestJs** and **Progressive Web App (PWA)**.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **React** projects.

🎻 Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from the **violin** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand** (only aiming from playing the **violin** though).

📚 I love reading **fictional novels** and books on **personal development**.

✈️ I love **traveling** as well, though it's been a while I last travelled.
